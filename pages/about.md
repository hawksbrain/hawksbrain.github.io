I grow garlic around Red Wing, Minnesota, down in the southeast corner. I am lucky to garden where I do… it’s down right beautiful. And friends support me by sharing their land with hawks brain.

At one time I grew 77 different varieties and close to 5,000 heads; had fun selling at the Minnesota Garlic Festival, the Red Wing Farmers Market, and the Renaissance Festival. I was fortunate to have those experiences but no longer sell at those venues.

Alas, I have slowly and steadily cut back and currently grow just enough to support our family, friends, and a few regular shoppers.

Feel free to inquire if any garlic is available using the ["contact us" link](/contact) . I strongly encourage you to check out [the growers that sell at the Minnesota Garlic Festival](https://www.mngarlicfest.com/growers) (and if you haven't gone to [the festival](https://www.mngarlicfest.com), GO!).

Thanks for checking my page. And for wanting garlic!!

Susan.
