				<p>This plot has fifty-one test varieties of porcelain, marbled purple stripe, purple stripe, and glazed purple stripe. It is the first year that I have grown these, given to me by Cannon Falls Joel. I feel there is pressure to make sure that they all survive and are taken care of like a real scientist would. Thank goodness they all came up this spring otherwise I&#x2019;d have to admit to Joel that I have failed the job already. It is a happy feeling one gets&#x2026;like a mother seeing all the wee ones growing so strong, each garlic having it&#x2019;s own look and characteristic.</p>
