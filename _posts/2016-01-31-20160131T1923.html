<div class="entry">
				<p>it is common at the beginning of a new year to make resolutions. to test oneself and see if follow-through can actually occur. i only made one necessary one this time around: to do stretches for my tight muscles on a daily basis. so far, so good. but last week i added a new challenge to myself&#x2013;to post on the hawk&#x2019;s brain website on a monthly basis. wow! so here i am, on the last day of january, following through on my new challenge. and once i get my photos uploaded, i&#x2019;ll add them, too. so until february, stay warm and stretch!</p>
