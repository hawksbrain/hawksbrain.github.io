				<p>As I look at the rest of my garlic that is of unknown variety, I realize it is time to finish it up and make it into garlic powder. But maybe I&#x2019;ll wait until the temperature on the front porch is above zero degrees.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve learned from Cannon Falls Joel that you can&#x2019;t make powder in the house&#x2013;gets a little too fragrant.</p>
