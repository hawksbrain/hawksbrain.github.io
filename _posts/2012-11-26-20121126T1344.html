				<p>If you are checking the website, then boy do I have a deal for you. I have beautiful garlic left over from planting. Let me know if you want a few bulbs. They are nice little gifts. Email hawk&#x2019;s brain on the Contact Us page&#x2026;while supplies last.</p>
<p>Time to make garlic powder as the season changes. And the roasting of many cloves at a time. Yum in the tum.</p>
<p>Keep an ear out on the phytoplasma concern in the midwest garlic crops. Should be interesting&#x2026;.</p>
