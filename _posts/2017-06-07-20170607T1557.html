				<p>everyone is telling me how beautiful their garlic is growing this year. always good to share stories with others. the rain in may really helped, but right now on the seventh of june, the rain could come back. too hot and dry. we are never happy, are we? the first day of the red wing farmers market was last saturday and went well. make sure you support your local farmers!!<a href="#" rel="attachment wp-att-352"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-352" title="IMG_6555" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_6555.jpg" alt width="456" height="342"></a></p>
