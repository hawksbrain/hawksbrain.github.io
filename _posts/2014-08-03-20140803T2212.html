				<p>thanks to those of you who have kept in touch with me through this forgotten web site. we are alive and well in red wing, minnesota, and happy to report that the garlic is healthy, harvested, and hanging to dry&#x2026;awaiting to be eaten and enjoyed.</p>
<p>important dates for you to know:</p>
<p>** minnesota garlic festival&#x2013;august 9th at mcleod county fairgrounds in hutchinson. a good time, always.</p>
