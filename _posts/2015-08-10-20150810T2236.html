				<p>The garlic is better than ever in Minnesota this year.</p>
<p>With the Tenth Annual Minnesota Garlic Festival coming up this Saturday, August 15th, the 15 garlic vendors scheduled to be there will be strutting their stuff! hawk&#x2019;s brain garlic included.</p>
<p>We will be at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival over Labor Day weekend. Susan and her garlic will specifically be there on Saturday, September 5th.</p>
<p>We will be at our local Red Wing Farmers&#x2019; Market most Saturdays (sans the 5th September) starting August 22.</p>
<p>Feel free to email through this website to confirm if&#xA0; and where we will be.</p>
