<div class="entry">
				<p>it&#x2019;s that time of the year when&#xA0; my garlic invades my home. and everyday it gets worse. my floors are covered with garlic to dry a little more and give me easier access to clean them.</p>
<p>i&#x2019;ll have more varieties and garlic than ever this saturday at the festival. mention the words &#x201C;pink envelope&#x201D; and get one free bulb for the first six you purchase.</p>
<p>see you there!</p>
