<div class="entry">
				<p style="text-align: left;">For eighteen years the Sustainable Farming Association of Minnesota has been holding conferences. On a nice Saturday in February, 450 people came to St. Olaf to listen to speakers, share ideas, and eat good food. Joel Salatin (from the famed <em>Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma)</em> was the keynote speaker.&#xA0; Jerry Ford from the Crow Wing River Chapter was a major worker-bee of the conference. He is the stinky creator of our wonderful Minnesota Garlic Festival. Next year&#x2019;s sustainable ag conference is scheduled for February 20, 2010&#x2013;place to be determined. Mark your calendars and don&#x2019;t miss out on great conversation and thoughts for a healthier world.</p>
