				<p>The Seventh Annual Minnesota Garlic Festival last Saturday was a BLAST! and a HIT!! We had a ball and it looked like everyone else attending did also.</p>
<p>If you missed us there and need that special garlic, come see us at the Renaissance Festival THIS weekend, August 18 and 19th. Our booth is in the same place&#x2013;near the Pavilion. Watch the spaghetti eating contest while purchasing your fresh home-grown Minnesota garlic.</p>
